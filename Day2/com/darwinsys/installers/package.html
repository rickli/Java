<h1>Desktop Software Installers</h1>
<p>This package contains classes useful in building installers.
You still need to write some code, which will be detailed
here later. Briefly, you need to write a class called 
<kbd>installer.Installer</kbd>,
and create a Jar with InstallerUnpacker as its Main-class
(in the Manifest).
Some time later, when the user launches this jar,
InstallerUnpacker will unpack your installer into a temporary
directory and run it for you.
